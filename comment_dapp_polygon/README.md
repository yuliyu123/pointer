# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```




    npx hardhat run --network matic scripts/deploy-and-seed.js

    Contract deployed to: 0xB3E742393DCe025BBC9E97A7D0b80f941c23B70a

    npm run dev
